  <div class="item6">CO!E, born Cole Phillips, is an 18 year-old artist, producer, and audio engineer from Dallas, Texas. Growing up, Cole played drums after his father, and his love for music gave him the inspiration to teach himself piano and guitar. From there he started making beats. Cole went on to being a full time producer after releasing his LP titled “Colors,” which depicted each color’s emotion through the beat, on SoundCloud. During a rough patch, Cole decided to start putting his emotions to paper. He released multiple projects to showcase his music, which is seen from the styles of bedroom pop, meme rap, and lo-fi hip hop. With the help of TikTok, Cole’s song titled “Dead & Cold” reached over 6M streams. Cole works closely with artists: Ian Bolen, Saucy Mike, KIL, YAMIYO and a few others from around the world. Upon graduating high-school, Cole is looking to keep pursuing music by studying audio engineering at Millikin University & learning more about being an artist.
